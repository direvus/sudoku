Sudoku
======

A small sudoku library written in Go.

I wrote this library in order to learn the Go programming language.  It is not
intended to be useful, or expected to be novel.

The original inspiration for the library and the input format comes from
Andrew Gerrand's November 2015 Go Challenge
[http://golang-challenge.org/go-challenge8/], although this library is not
written as a submission for that challenge.
